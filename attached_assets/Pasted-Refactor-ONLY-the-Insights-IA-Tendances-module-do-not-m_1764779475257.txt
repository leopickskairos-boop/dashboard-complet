Refactor ONLY the “Insights IA & Tendances” module (do not modify any other part of the dashboard).

### GOAL
Turn this section into a premium, consulting-style insights hub, including:

1) Title block remains: “Insights IA & Tendances”
2) Remove the "Voir plus" link.
3) Keep the 3 existing insight cards EXACTLY in their style, BUT normalize their height and spacing (same padding, same border radius, same distance).
4) Add a NEW fourth card on the right side, SAME WIDTH & SAME HEIGHT as the two bottom cards.

### NEW CARD CONTENT
Card title: **Clients convertis automatiquement (7 derniers jours)**  
Subtitle (small): **Impact IA hebdomadaire**

Inside the card, render:

### A MINI LINE-CHART (Trade Republic style)
- Data source: number of converted clients per day (last 7 days)
- Style:
    - Smooth bezier curve
    - Subtle neon green glow only on the peaks
    - No gridlines
    - Very minimalist axes
    - Soft gradient under the curve (top transparent → bottom #00FFB210)
- Tooltip on hover showing: “DAY – X clients”
- Dot markers on hover only (not persistent)
- Line color: #00FFB2 (muted neon green, not aggressive)

### BELOW THE GRAPH
Add a short business-impact sentence in muted grey (#A0A0A0):
“Cette semaine, l’IA a converti X nouveaux clients automatiquement.”

Where X = sum of the 7 values.

### CARD STYLE
- Same border-radius as the other insight cards
- Background: #111216 (same as existing)
- Subtle inner shadow to give depth: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)
- Outer shadow diffuse: rgba(0,255,178,0.12) ONLY behind the card, not on the border
- Balanced padding so the graph is clean

### LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS
- The 1st (big) insight stays full width above.
- The 2nd row must be 3 cards: Performance / Tendances / NEW Graph Card
- All 3 cards in the row MUST have equal width and automatic height alignment.

### TYPOGRAPHY (apply only inside Insights area)
- Title: Inter Tight / 20px / semi-bold
- Labels: Inter Tight / 13px / medium
- Numbers: Inter Tight / 22px / semi-bold
- Muted hints: Inter Tight / 12px / normal / #A0A0A0

### DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE
- Do not alter the global layout
- Do not alter colors of other modules
- Do not alter spacing of any other part of the dashboard

Only modify the Insights IA & Tendances module.
